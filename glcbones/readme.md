# GLCBones
This is my humble attempt to streamline the setup of a Wordpress site built on Bootstrap styles. It also implements Fontawesome over Bootstrap's glyphicons just because I like them better. I used the "Bones" theme as my starting point and give super high marks to Mr. Machado for a theme code base that was so well documented that it taught me most of what I needed to know to get things rolling.
